# Todo List Project

### Todo List | The Odin Project | JavaScript

This is the forth project of the "JavaScript" course within "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to build a "To-do list" application that lets you track various tasks according to your specifications.

This app is used to practice the SOLID design principles, object composition, modules, and bundling via Webpack.
*Of course, this includes subjects introduced in previous projects.*

**Skills demonstrated: object composition, ES6 modules, webpack, SOLID design principles**

**Webpage responsiveness: THIS PROJECT WILL NOT DISPLAY PROPERLY ON MOBILE DEVICES**
